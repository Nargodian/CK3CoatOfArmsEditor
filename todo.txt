1. Change prestige to splendor to match in-game
	- update variable names (prestige_level → splendor_level)
	- update UI labels and tooltips
	- update comments/documentation

2. Bugs
	- prestige is correctly defaulting but the dropdown still shows level 0

3. Redo frames to follow the in-game levels
	- Base Origins = 0
	- Obscure = 0
	- Insignificant = 1
	- Noteworthy = 1
	- Reputable = 2
	- Well-Known = 2
	- Significant = 3
	- Famous = 3
	- Glorious = 4
	- Fabled = 4
	- Legendary = 5

4. Rename toolbar buttons to clarify context
	- "Copy to Clipboard" (exports full CoA)
	- "Paste from Clipboard" (imports full CoA)

5. Undo/Redo System
	- create undo history
	- hook up undo and redo to undo history
	- connect actions taken:
		- layer operations
			- create
			- delete
			- reordering
			- duplicating
		- properties
			- position (pos_x, pos_y)
			- scale (scale_x, scale_y)
			- rotation
			- flip (flip_x, flip_y)
			- unified scale toggle
			- emblem colors (color1, color2, color3)
			- base colors (pattern color1, color2, color3)
			- base pattern/texture changes
			- emblem texture changes
			- avoid spam when sliding up and down
		- CoA level operations
			- frame changes
			- splendor level changes
			- new/open/save operations
	- grey out undo when there's no more to undo (beginning)
	- grey out redo when there's no more to redo (latest)
	- ctrl+z undo
	- ctrl+y redo

6. Layer Copy/Paste System
	- ctrl+c copy layer (serialized as CoA sub-block)
	- ctrl+v paste layer (from serialized sub-block)
	- smart paste detection (for paste from clipboard): if clipboard contains layer sub-block, paste as layer instead of throwing error

7. Other Features
	- ctrl+s saves
	- new layers add or add from the assets will be placed on the top of the layer stack ie the most in front
	- in widget make sure the layers are displaced in the layer tab
		- top for most infront
		- bottom for most behind
	- (when mouse is over the top of the canvas)
		- ctrl+v paste layer
		- will be placed at the mouse position
		- with the position clamped to the nearest legal position
		- otherwise it will just paste over the top
	- make any area of the transform AABB grabbable for translation
	- ctrl+drag with a transform widget duplicates layer
		- be careful not to spam that and only let it fire once per drag
